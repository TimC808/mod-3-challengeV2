# Password Generator Starter Code

Bootcamp Module-3-Challenge to create a random password generator.

For challenge assignments that include starter code, remember that there are few steps we need to take before we start coding to make sure that 1) we’re working in our own repository rather than the one containing the starter code and 2) we’re setting up our file structure so that index.html deploys properly:
Create your own Github repo (including a README file)
Clone the new repo onto your computer
Either clone the starter code from the link provided in Bootcamp Spot/Canvas or access the starter code in the class GitLab repo
Copy all of the files/folders contained inside the /Develop folder
Note: we don’t want to actually include /Develop in our own repo because it will prevent index.html from deploying correctly
Paste the copied files into your own Github repository that you cloned in step 2
Add, commit, and push the starter code to Github
You’re ready!
Taking these steps before you start work on an assignment with starter code will ensure that you’re setting future you up for success. :rocket:

AS AN employee with access to sensitive data
I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria
SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security

Acceptance Criteria:
GIVEN I need a new, secure password
WHEN I click the button to generate a password
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
WHEN prompted for password criteria
THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
WHEN prompted for the length of the password
THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
WHEN asked for character types to include in the password
THEN I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
WHEN I answer each prompt
THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
WHEN all prompts are answered
THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
WHEN the password is generated
THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page
